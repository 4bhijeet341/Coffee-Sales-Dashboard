# Coffee-Sales-Dashboard
Welcome to the "Coffee Shop Dashboard" project! This MS Excel endeavor dives into a dataset of transaction records from a fictional NYC coffee shop. The overarching objective is to transform raw data into actionable insights, culminating in an intuitive and visually compelling dashboard. Key milestones include revenue calculations, temporal breakdowns, and insightful PivotTables and Pivot Charts. The resultant dashboard serves as a strategic tool for understanding transaction patterns, product performance, and store-specific insights. With integrated slicers for enhanced user interaction, this project encapsulates a holistic approach to data analysis in the context of a bustling coffee shop environment.
